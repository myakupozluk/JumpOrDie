# Jump Or Die!

Welcome to a 2D platformer where the rules don‚Äôt apply and the game is built to troll you.  
Platforms disappear, spikes come out of nowhere, and nothing behaves the way it should.  
This isn‚Äôt a bug ‚Äî it‚Äôs the game design.

## üéÆ Game Features

- **Troll Platforms**  
  Some platforms move, vanish, or fall the moment you jump toward them.

- **Random Spikes**  
  Hidden traps activate at the worst possible moment ‚Äî because why not?

- **Unpredictable Triggers**  
  Step on something? A wall moves. Touch a coin? The floor breaks. Logic has left the game.

- **Fake Paths & Dead Ends**  
  The obvious path is usually the wrong one. Exploration is dangerous.

- **Sudden Death Zones**  
  Safe-looking areas might instantly kill you. Even checkpoints lie.

- **Minimal Hints**  
  No tutorials, no handholding. You learn through pain.

- **Rage-Inducing Level Design**  
  Built to frustrate, confuse, and make you yell, "WHAT WAS THAT?!"

- **Dark Humor & Chaos**  
  A platformer that‚Äôs less about winning ‚Äî and more about surviving the joke.
